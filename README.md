# Signature Embedding
A Deep Metric Learning Approach to Signature Verification

## About this Project
The motivation of this work and the approach taken can be found in [Signature Embedding: Writer Independent Offline Signature Verification with Deep Metric Learning](https://hpi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/fachgebiete/meinel/tele-task/papers/isvc16_Hannes.pdf).

This project is an effort to re-implement the system presented in the paper, leveraging the knowledge I gained in the previous project and the technological advances since then, for example in the Chainer deep learning framework.
